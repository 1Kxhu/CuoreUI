BUGS

1. cuiControlAnimator on controls with BackColor == Color.Transparent
2. the short period of time when a white rectangle on the top left appears when using both cuiFormRounder and cuiFormAnimator combined
(RoundedForm.cs's bitmap isnt set and the form is forced to show itself anyway)

FEATURES

1. Theme controller: (will come as a different nuget package, not a part of cuoreui.winforms)
 - cuiThemeManager
 - cuiThemeDefiner

2. big cleanup:
 - remove duplicates
 - remove unused content
 - rephrase comments
 - let cuiTextBox (legacy) die in sake of cuiTextBox2
