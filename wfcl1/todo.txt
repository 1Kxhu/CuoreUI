BUGS

1. cuiControlAnimator on controls with BackColor == Color.Transparent
2. the short period of time when a white rectangle on the top left appears when using both cuiFormRounder and cuiFormAnimator combined
(RoundedForm.cs's bitmap isnt set and the form is forced to show itself anyway)

FEATURES

1. Theme controller:
 - cuiThemeManager
 - cuiThemeDefiner

2. big cleanup:
 - remove duplicates
 - remove unused content
 - rephrase comments
 - let cuiTextBox (legacy) die in sake of cuiTextBox2

3. cursor fix (loaded automatically with cuore)
- replace old windows cursor: HAND icon that winforms uses with what is supposed to be the user's actual HAND cursor
