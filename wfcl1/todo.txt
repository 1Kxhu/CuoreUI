1. 
Theme controller:
 - cuiThemeManager
 - cuiThemeDefiner

 So far thinking of it like this:
  - cuiThemeManager will hold all themes and will be the 'switch'
	it will contain an array of cuiThemeDefiner(s)
  - cuiThemeDefiner will use reflection to get all public 'Color' properties 
	it will have a TargetControl property and all all of
	the Color properties will be held in an int array
  
  Potential drawbacks are performance, but this is winforms so oh well

2.
cuiSlider rewrite:
 you could probably notice the thumb location issues
 i keep changing the slider thumb location code often so i will look into that

3.
cuiFormAnimator:
 Win32 animatewindow type stuff if compatible, if not, do custom ones

4.
Improve on cuiFormRounder:
 So that when a control is clipping at the edge of the form, the RoundedForm considers nearby pixels of the TargetForm
