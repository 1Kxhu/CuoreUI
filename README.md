THE SUCCESSOR TO FOURUI (NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION YET)

# What is CuoreUI?
It's a C# .NET Winforms UI Library similar to FourUI.
This is just basically FourUI rewritten + I plan to add more, because I thought to myself I could do better than what FourUI was.
In short, as previously said, it's an UI Library, that tries to keep winforms alive for a little more.
I try to do this through adding properties such as corner rounding and drawing everything with antialias.

# Why should you use CuoreUI?
I add unique elements such as "cuiFormRounder", which is the first component I know of that smoothly rounds up the target form.
There's also other cool stuff like the "cuiControlBlur", which blurs controls. The controls' designs are also pretty modern-looking.

# How to download and use CuoreUI?
The latest beta releases can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/1Kxhu/CuoreUI/releases) at the releases section.
While this library looks good, it's still not production ready. There are many controls I want to try to add so stay tuned.
