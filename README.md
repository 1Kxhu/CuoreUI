THE SUCCESSOR TO FOURUI

# What is CuoreUI?
It's a C# .NET Winforms UI Framework similar to FourUI.
This is just basically FourUI rewritten, because I thought to myself I could do better than what FourUI was.
In short, as previously said, it's an UI Framework, that tries to keep winforms alive for a little more.
I try to do this through adding properties such as corner rounding and drawing everything with antialias.

# Why should you use CuoreUI?
As of the 8th March 2024, there is really no reason.
However, give it a couple of months and I'm sure I'll add lots of more interesting controls and components.

# How to download and use CuoreUI?
At the moment, I'm not providing any direct release, because it's still in active development.
If you still want to give it a try, you can download the source and compile it to see it for yourself.
