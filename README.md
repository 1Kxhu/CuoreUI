# What is CuoreUI?
A C# .NET Winforms UI Library with modern-looking controls, components and forms.

# Why should you use CuoreUI?
Have you ever used an UI Library only to find out you need a license, it is unpolished, or it was abandoned?

**CuoreUI might be the solution.**

I plan to update this Library as long as I can.

The library features many controls with a sleek, xiaomi-like design, some even animated. Check out the cuiFormRounder component, you won't be disappointed! 

# How to download and use CuoreUI?
Latest Releases: [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CuoreUI.Winforms/).

Older Releases (+ DLL): [GitHub](https://github.com/1Kxhu/CuoreUI/releases).
