# A WinForms library.. 
This is a C# .NET Winforms UI Library with modern-looking controls, components and forms.

The library features many controls with a sleek design inspired by Xiaomi and modern Web UI design.

## 🗿 Why use CuoreUI?
Have you ever used a UI Library only to find out you need a license, it is unpolished, or it was abandoned?

**CuoreUI might be the solution.**

CuoreUI will be alive for as long as possible!

## 🖋️ Versioning
**We use the following format:**
`yyyy.mm.dd.hotfix`

**yyyy** stands for the year. (like 2012)

**mm** stands for the month. (it can be both single digit and 2 digits) 

**dd** stands for the day (it can be both single digit and 2 digits) 

**hotfix** stands for the amount of bugfix updates made that day. 

> An example version would be 2022.9.2. It means the update came out on the 2nd day of the 9th month in the year 2022 - that's September 2nd, 2022 and no bugfixes were made.
