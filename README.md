# What is CuoreUI?
A C# .NET Winforms UI Library with modern-looking controls, components and forms.

# Why should you use CuoreUI?
Have you ever used an UI Library only to find out you need a license, it is unpolished, or it was abandoned?
Well, this is none of that. I plan to update this Library as long as I can, I will update it until I physically can't.
I add unique elements such as "cuiFormRounder", which is the first component I know of that smoothly rounds up the target form with low cpu/ram usage.
There's also other awesome stuff like the "cuiControlBlur", which blurs controls, or a literal SVG Renderer all In-Winforms!

# How to download and use CuoreUI?
Releases may be outdated until the end of beta.
The latest beta releases can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/1Kxhu/CuoreUI/releases) at the releases section.
While this library looks good, it's still not production ready. There are many controls I want to try to add so stay tuned.
